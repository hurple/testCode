Here are a few examples of code as requested for req4554.  

All code I've written previous to this is in the State Farm system.  My fingerprints are all through
ECS, and I have no examples at home per compliance standards.  So, I do not have any of my previous work
to share.  I put together a quick web-page as an example.  I also wrote a pair of SQL scripts similar to 
the type I wrote on an almost daily basis while in ECS at State Farm.  

Please feel free to contact me with any further requests or questions.
